# Children's Privacy & COPPA Policy

Effective date: 2026-01-26

Important notice: This COPPA Policy is intended to help you comply with the United States Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) where it applies. It is a template and informational in nature and does not constitute legal advice. Consult counsel to confirm compliance with COPPA and any other applicable child-privacy laws (including state, national, or international laws such as GDPR where relevant).

## 1. Purpose and Scope
This policy describes how [Organization / Product Name] ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information from children under the age of 13, and the procedures we follow to obtain verifiable parental consent as required by COPPA for U.S. users. It applies to all services, websites, applications, and products operated by us that are directed to children under 13 or have actual knowledge that they collect personal information from children under 13.

If your service is accessible to children outside the United States, additional legal requirements may apply (for example, parental consent or parental notification obligations under local laws). This policy addresses COPPA specifically.

## 2. Definitions
- Child / children: A natural person under the age of 13, for purposes of COPPA.
- Personal information: Information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to a particular child. Typical categories include persistent identifiers (cookies, device IDs), name, contact information (email, postal address), location information, photos, videos, voice recordings, and other identifiers described below.
- Operator: Any person or entity that operates a website or online service and collects personal information from children and is subject to COPPA.

## 3. Types of Personal Information Collected From Children
We limit collection of children's personal information to what is reasonably necessary to participate in the service. Examples of categories we may collect (only when necessary and with parental consent where required):
- Identifiers: Full name, username, date of birth.
- Contact information: Parent's or child's email address, postal address, or telephone number (only if needed and with parental consent).
- Persistent identifiers: Device identifiers, advertising IDs, cookies, or other identifiers used to support gameplay, personalization, or analytics.
- Media: Photos, videos, audio recordings uploaded by the child (only when necessary).
- Content: Text entered by a child (chat messages, profile bios) — minimized and monitored per safety policies.
- Behavioral data: Game progress, in-app purchases, interaction logs, and analytics for improving service.
- Location information: Only when essential and only with strict limits (generalized/approximate if possible).

We do not knowingly collect Sensitive Data from children (e.g., Social Security numbers, financial account numbers, medical information) unless explicitly required and following legal guidance and heightened protections.

## 4. How We Use Children's Personal Information
We use children's personal information only for the purpose it was collected, such as:
- Providing and personalizing the product or service (gameplay, profiles, content delivery).
- Communicating with a parent for verifying and managing parental consent and parental requests.
- Safety, moderation, and preventing abuse.
- Analytics to improve the product — only in aggregated or pseudonymized form where feasible.
- Legal compliance and to respond to law enforcement or safety issues.

We do not use children's personal information for targeted advertising without express verifiable parental consent.

## 5. Verifiable Parental Consent
When we collect personal information from children under 13 and the service is subject to COPPA, we obtain verifiable parental consent prior to the collection, use, or disclosure of such information.

Permitted methods of verifiable parental consent may include (select and implement appropriate methods depending on risk and context):
- Providing a consent form and requiring a signed, returned form by mail, fax, or electronic scan.
- Requiring a parent to make a credit card transaction of a minimal amount (not to be used as a purchase; must be used only for verification), for which the parent is informed.
- Calling a trained company representative who obtains consent and documents it.
- Using government-issued ID methods combined with a reasonable process to delete copied ID after verification.
- Using a reliable online parental verification service.
- Using other reasonable methods approved by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

We maintain records demonstrating that verifiable parental consent was obtained and maintain copies of consent for the period required by law.

Sample Parental Consent Affirmation (example):
- Child's name:
- Child's date of birth:
- Product / Service name:
- Parent's full name:
- Parent's email:
- Parent's phone:
- Parent's signature / consent method (e.g., "I authorize via online verification on [date/time]").

(See Appendix A for a sample consent form.)

## 6. Parental Rights & Controls
Parents have the right to:
- Review the personal information collected about their child.
- Refuse further collection or use of their child's personal information.
- Revoke consent at any time (in which case we will delete the child's personal information as required).
- Request deletion or modification of their child's personal information.
- Request that we stop disclosing their child's personal information to third parties.

To exercise rights, parents may contact us at:
- Email: privacy@[yourdomain].com
- Postal mail: [Organization Name], Attn: Privacy, [Address]
- Phone: [Phone number]

We will verify the identity of the requesting parent before fulfilling requests, using reasonable steps to ensure the request is from the parent who provided consent.

## 7. Data Minimization and Retention
- Minimization: We collect only the data necessary to provide the requested service or for safety/compliance reasons.
- Retention: We retain children's personal information only as long as necessary to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements. When data is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.
- Records of parental consent and any verifiable steps used to obtain it will be retained for a reasonable period to demonstrate compliance (recommendation: at least 3 years).

## 8. Disclosure to Third Parties
We will not disclose children's personal information to third parties except:
- To service providers who process data on our behalf under contract and only for permitted purposes (we require them to follow COPPA-level protections).
- When required to comply with legal processes, governmental requests, or to protect the safety of users or the public.
- When we have obtained verifiable parental consent for a specific disclosure.

We prohibit third parties from using children’s personal information for their own independent purposes (e.g., behavioral advertising) unless verifiable parental consent is obtained.

## 9. Security & Safeguards
We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect children's personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Security measures include:
- Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest where appropriate.
- Access controls and role-based access to personal information.
- Regular security assessments and patching.
- Data minimization and anonymization where feasible.

In case of a data breach involving children's personal information, we will follow applicable breach notification laws and notify parents and regulators as required.

## 10. Age Screening / Age Gates
We implement age screening mechanisms to identify users under 13 in contexts where age matters:
- Clear age gates on sign-up flows: asking for date of birth or age.
- If the child indicates they are under 13, the service either:
  - Requires parental consent before collecting personal information, or
  - Restricts the functionality to non-personalized or limited features that do not collect personal information.
- We do not rely solely on self-declared age; where there is actual knowledge that a user is a child, COPPA protections apply regardless of an age declaration.

## 11. Advertising & Analytics
- Targeted advertising to children under 13 is prohibited unless verifiable parental consent is obtained and disclosures are clear.
- We do not permit third-party behavioral advertising to children under 13.
- Analytics used on children's services will be configured to minimize personal data collection (e.g., aggregated/pseudonymized) and will comply with COPPA obligations.

## 12. Cookies & Tracking
We will disclose any persistent identifiers collected from children (cookies, device IDs). Where possible, we will use ephemeral identifiers and provide clear disclosures. Cookies or trackers used for analytics must be COPPA-compliant and not enable targeted behavioral advertising without parental consent.

## 13. Moderation & Safety
Content contributed by children is moderated according to our safety and content policies. We do not publish personally identifying information of children in public areas.

## 14. Cross-Border Transfers
If personal information of children is transferred outside the United States, we will ensure appropriate safeguards and parental notices as required. COPPA applies to operators in the USA and to operators outside the USA if they have actual knowledge they are collecting information from children in the USA.

## 15. Recordkeeping and Accountability
We maintain:
- Records of what categories of personal information are collected and how they are used.
- Records of verifiable parental consent and the methods used.
- Documentation of third parties who receive children’s personal information and the purposes of disclosure.
- Policies and training for employees handling children's data.

We designate a data protection contact responsible for children’s privacy compliance.

## 16. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will post the revised policy with its effective date and notify parents where appropriate (e.g., by email) about material changes.
