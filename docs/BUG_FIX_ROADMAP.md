# Bug-Fix Roadmap - Pre-Render Deployment

**Timeline**: 2 months minimum before production deployment  
**Target**: Render (Backend + ML) + Vercel (Frontend)  
**Estimated Cost**: $14/month production

---

## 🔧 MAJOR BUGS (Week 3-4)

### Issue #4: Missing Health Check Routes
**Status**: 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Files**: Multiple API routes  
**Impact**: Can't verify service status

**Fix**:
- Ensure all services expose `/health` endpoint
- Return proper status codes (200/503)
- Include dependency health (DB, external APIs)

---

### Issue #5: Error Logging Incomplete
**Status**: 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Current**: Errors logged only if DB connected  
**Fix**: Implement fallback error logging to file system

---

### Issue #6: CORS Configuration Inconsistent
**Status**: 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Issue**: Different CORS settings across services  
**Fix**: Centralize CORS config, whitelist production domains

---

## 🔐 SECURITY FIXES (Week 5-6)

### Issue #7: JWT Authentication Not Implemented
**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**File**: `apps/backend/src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts`  
**Current**: Placeholder functions only

**Fix Steps**:
1. Implement proper JWT signing/verification
2. Add token expiration (15min access, 7d refresh)
3. Secure token storage (httpOnly cookies)
4. Add refresh token rotation

---

### Issue #8: Encryption Methods Are Placeholders
**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**File**: `packages/shared/src/libs/utils/securityUtils.ts`  
**Current**: Returns plaintext

**Fix Steps**:
1. Use Web Crypto API for encryption
2. Implement AES-256-GCM encryption
3. Secure key management (environment variables)
4. Add data integrity checks (HMAC)

---

### Issue #9: No Rate Limiting on Critical Endpoints
**Status**: 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Fix**: Add endpoint-specific rate limits (login, payment, predictions)

---

## 🧒 COPPA COMPLIANCE (Week 7-8)

### Issue #10: Parental Consent System Missing
**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL (Legal Risk)  
**Required**: Verifiable parental consent for users <13

**Implementation**:
1. Email verification for parent
2. Credit card verification ($0.50 auth)
3. Consent record storage (immutable logs)
4. Periodic re-verification (annually)

---

### Issue #11: Age Verification Incomplete
**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Current**: Client-side only  
**Fix**: Server-side age verification on all restricted endpoints

---

### Issue #12: Data Subject Rights APIs Missing
**Status**: 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Required**: GDPR/COPPA data export and deletion

**Implementation**:
- `/api/user/export` - Download all user data
- `/api/user/delete` - Delete account and data
- Email confirmation for both

---

## 🎯 PERFORMANCE & STABILITY (Month 2)

### Issue #13: No Request Timeout Handling
**Fix**: Add 30s timeout to all external API calls

### Issue #14: Missing Database Indexes
**Fix**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields (userId, createdAt)

### Issue #15: No Graceful Shutdown
**Fix**: Implement SIGTERM handlers for clean shutdowns

### Issue #16: Memory Leaks in ML Service
**Fix**: Clear prediction cache periodically, limit batch sizes

### Issue #17: Frontend API Calls Not Optimized
**Fix**: Implement request deduplication, cache predictions
