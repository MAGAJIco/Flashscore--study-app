Kids Mode & COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) â€” Privacy Notice

Overview
We take the privacy and safety of children seriously. This page explains how our Kids Mode and COPPA compliance works.

1) Age collection and purpose
- During signup we ask for the user's age to determine eligibility for Kids Mode.
- If the user is under 13, Kids Mode is enabled by default and we restrict features that are not appropriate for children (see Restrictions below).

2) What data we collect for children
- Minimal necessary information: email (to create account), non-sensitive profile information.
- We only collect additional data with verifiable parental consent.

3) Parental consent
- For users under 13 we will require verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information for purposes beyond account creation.
- Parents can verify consent via a secure link or other reasonable verification methods. After verification we will record consent status with timestamps.

4) Restrictions in Kids Mode
- We hide all gambling/betting related content (odds, betting tips, wager flows, deposit/withdraw).
- We disable personalized advertising, targeted analytics, in-app purchases, and public chat features until parental consent is provided (where applicable).
- We minimize data collection: analytics collection is reduced, and identifiers used for profiling are disabled.

5) Parental rights
- Parents may review, correct, or request deletion of their child's personal information by contacting us at privacy@<your-domain>.
- Parents may revoke consent at any time; we will stop further collection/use and delete data on request per our deletion policy.

6) Contact & Notices
- For questions about children's privacy, contact: privacy@<your-domain>
