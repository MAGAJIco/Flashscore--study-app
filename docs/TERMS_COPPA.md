COPPA Addendum â€” Terms of Service (short summary)

If you are the parent or guardian of a user under 13:
- You must provide verifiable parental consent before your child can access features that collect personal information beyond registration.
- Your child will be placed into Kids Mode by default. Certain features (gambling content, in-app purchases, targeted ads, public chats) will be restricted.
- You have the right to review, delete, and obtain a copy of your child's personal information. To exercise those rights, please contact privacy@<your-domain>.

This addendum supplements our main Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In case of conflicts, the COPPA addendum controls for users identified as under 13.
