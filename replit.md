## Replit Configuration

### Workflows
- **Frontend** (Port 5000): `cd apps/frontend && pnpm dev`
  - Serves the Next.js application on 0.0.0.0:5000
  - Configured with allowedDevOrigins for Replit proxy
  - WebView output type for browser preview

### Environment Variables
The app uses MongoDB for data persistence and NextAuth for authentication. **Required** environment variables:

**Authentication (Required)**:
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token signing (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string (format: `mongodb://` or `mongodb+srv://`)

**Optional**:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Google OAuth client ID (for Google sign-in)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google OAuth client secret (for Google sign-in)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:3001)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

**Important**: The app will fail to start if `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` or `MONGODB_URI` are not set or improperly formatted. This is a security feature to prevent production deployment with unsafe defaults.

Environment variables can be configured through Replit's Secrets panel.

### Deployment

The application is configured for Replit deployment with autoscale:

**Replit Deployment**:
- Build: `pnpm install && cd apps/frontend && pnpm build`
- Start: `cd apps/frontend && pnpm start`
- Port: 5000 (serves on 0.0.0.0)
- Deployment type: Autoscale (stateless Next.js app)
- Click the "Deploy" button in Replit to publish your app

**External Deployment Options** (optional):
- Backend can be deployed to Render using `render.yaml`
- Frontend previously configured for Vercel (see `apps/frontend/vercel.json`)

## Development

### Running the App
The frontend workflow is already configured and runs automatically on port 5000.

### Installing Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Building for Production
```bash
cd apps/frontend && pnpm build
```

### Backend and ML Services (Optional)
These services are currently optional and can be started separately:
```bash
# Backend (Port 3001)
cd apps/backend && pnpm dev

# ML Service (Port 8000)
cd apps/backend/ml && python main.py
```

## Port Configuration
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Port 5000 (0.0.0.0)
- **Backend (Fastify)**: Port 3001 (localhost)
- **ML Service (FastAPI)**: Port 8000 (0.0.0.0)

## Authentication System

**Implemented: October 17, 2025**

Sports Central now has a complete authentication system:

### Features
- **Email/Password Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
- **Google OAuth**: Ready for Google sign-in (requires API keys)
- **Session Management**: JWT-based sessions with NextAuth
- **Age Verification**: COPPA-compliant (13+ years required)
- **Secure User Model**: MongoDB user collection with password, age, and access restrictions

### Pages
- `/auth/signup` - User registration with username, email, password, and age
- `/auth/signin` - Login with email/password or Google
- Dynamic NavBar showing user status (logged in/out)

### Security Features
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt before storage
- JWT tokens for session management
- Age-based access restrictions (betting/payments blocked for minors)
- Environment variable validation (fails fast if missing)
- No hard-coded secrets (production-safe)

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/[...nextauth]` - NextAuth authentication handlers
- `GET /api/auth/session` - Current session status

## Security Notes
- **CORS is configured with allowlist**: Only specific origins are allowed (no permissive `origin: true`)
- **MongoDB is optional in development**: App runs without database for local testing
- **Production database enforcement**: Set `REQUIRE_DB=true` or `NODE_ENV=production` to require database
- Service Worker is registered for PWA functionality
- The frontend uses 0.0.0.0:5000 to work with Replit's preview system

## Important Environment Variables
Before deploying to production, ensure these are set:
- `FRONTEND_URL`: The frontend URL for CORS validation
- `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN`: Automatically detected, but verify it's correct
- `REQUIRE_DB`: Set to 'true' in production to enforce database connection
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'production' for production deployments
- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
