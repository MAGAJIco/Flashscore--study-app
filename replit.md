# Sports Central - Replit Setup

## Overview
Sports Central is a premium monorepo sports prediction and community platform built with Next.js. It features AI-powered predictions, live scores, interactive experiences, and community rewards. The platform aims to provide a comprehensive multi-sport experience inspired by FlashScore, incorporating real-time data, personalized content, and engaging user interfaces. Key capabilities include multi-sport browsing, live scorecards with AI insights, an authentication system with age verification, and a Kids Mode for educational sports content.

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language in explanations. I want iterative development, so please ask before making major changes. I prefer detailed explanations for complex features.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a clean, responsive design with a Day/Night theme system, inspired by FlashScore's aesthetic. It includes a multi-sport selector, bottom navigation for easy access to key sections (All Games, Live, Favorites, News, Leagues), and live scorecards with AI prediction overlays. Kids Mode offers a colorful, engaging UI with a badge collection system. iOS-style features like haptic feedback, pull-to-refresh, and bottom sheet modals enhance the native app-like experience.

### Technical Implementations
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized into `apps/` (frontend, backend, ML service) and `packages/shared/` for shared utilities.
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. Configured for SSR-safe theme initialization and Vercel deployment.
- **Backend**: Fastify (Node.js 20) with MongoDB (Mongoose). Architecture follows routes → services → models pattern. All 7 route modules registered and connected:
  - Health & Monitoring: `/health`, `/health/metrics`
  - Predictions: `/api/predictions/*` (ML-powered with mlPredictionService and aiEnhancementService)
  - Matches: `/api/matches/*` (MongoDB with scraperServices)
  - News: `/api/news/*` (MongoDB)
  - Authors: `/api/news-authors/*` (Service Layer)
  - Foundation: `/api/foundation/:userId` (MongoDB)
  - Errors: `/api/errors/*` (MongoDB)
- **ML Service**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, scikit-learn, PyTorch.
- **Authentication**: NextAuth for email/password and Google OAuth, JWT-based sessions, bcrypt password hashing, and COPPA-compliant age verification (13+ years required).
- **Security**: Environment variable validation, CORS enabled with credentials support, no hard-coded secrets.
- **Deployment**: Configured for zero-cost deployment via Render (backend + ML service using Blueprint) and Vercel (frontend). See DEPLOY.md for detailed deployment instructions.
- **Port Configuration**: Frontend (5000), Backend (3001), ML Service (8000).
- **Database Models**: Match, News, NewsAuthor, Prediction, User, Foundation, ErrorLog (all indexed and optimized).
