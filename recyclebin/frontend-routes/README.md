## 🚀 Restoration Instructions

If you need to restore any archived route:

1. **Don't restore** - Use the new route group architecture instead
2. Copy functionality to appropriate route group
3. Update imports and navigation
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

**Recommended:** Build new features in the existing route group structure.

## 📝 Notes

- All components have been migrated to feature-specific directories
- Shared components remain in `apps/frontend/src/app/components/`
- Backend modules aligned with frontend route groups
- API endpoints organized by feature in `apps/backend/src/modules/`
