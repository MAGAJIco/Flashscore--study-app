MIGRATION GUIDE
===============

Feature-Based Architecture Migration
-------------------------------------

‚úÖ Completed
------------
- Route groups created for all features
- Backend modules reorganized
- Feature-based layouts implemented
- Shared components centralized
- Authentication system unified
- Kids mode COPPA compliance
- Multi-language support (i18n)
- PWA capabilities enabled

üîÑ In Progress
--------------
- Testing individual feature apps
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates
- Mobile app development (Android/iOS)
- Browser extension finalization

‚è≥ Planned
----------
- Deploy and monitor production
- User feedback integration
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Partnership integrations
- Blockchain verification (optional)
- AR prediction overlays

Migration Steps for Developers
-------------------------------

1. Update Route Structure
   - Old: /app/predictions/page.tsx
   - New: /app/[locale]/(predictions)/page.tsx

2. Use Shared Packages
   - Import from @magajico/shared
   - Centralized API clients
   - Common utilities and types

3. Implement Feature Layouts
   - Each route group has its own layout
   - Shared navigation components
   - Consistent theming

4. API Integration
   - Use centralized API client
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add loading states

5. State Management
   - Use React Context for global state
   - Local storage for persistence
   - Real-time updates via API

Breaking Changes
----------------
- Route paths now include [locale] prefix
- API endpoints moved to /api/ prefix
- Authentication requires JWT tokens
- Kids mode requires age verification

Rollback Plan
-------------
If issues occur, archived routes are available in:
recyclebin/frontend-routes/

To restore:
1. Copy route folder to apps/frontend/src/app/[locale]/
2. Update imports and navigation references
3. Test thoroughly before deploying
