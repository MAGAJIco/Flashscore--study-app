# Android Build Configuration Guide

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: These are configuration templates for Android build setup.**

This directory contains configuration files for building Sports Central as an Android app for Google Play Store. Before you can build, you need to initialize Capacitor to generate the actual Android project.

## üöÄ Initial Setup (REQUIRED)

First, you must initialize Capacitor:

```bash
# Install Capacitor CLI
npm install -g @capacitor/cli

# Install Capacitor dependencies
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android

# Initialize Capacitor (if not done)
npx cap init

# Add Android platform (this generates the full Android project)
npx cap add android

# Sync web assets to Android
npx cap sync android
```

**Note**: The configuration files in this directory (build.gradle, AndroidManifest.xml, etc.) serve as templates/reference. When you run `npx cap add android`, Capacitor will generate its own Android project structure which you can then customize using these templates as a guide.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before building, ensure you have:
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 11 or later
- Android SDK with API 35 installed
- Gradle 8.2 or later
- Node.js 20+ (for frontend build)
- Capacitor CLI installed

## üèóÔ∏è Build Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies (from project root)
npm install

# Build the frontend for production
cd apps/frontend
npm run build
cd ../..
```

### 2. Generate Android Project (Using Capacitor)

```bash
# Install Capacitor CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g @capacitor/cli

# Initialize Capacitor (if not already done)
npx cap init

# Add Android platform
npx cap add android

# Sync web assets to Android
npx cap sync android
```

### 3. Open in Android Studio

```bash
# Open Android project
npx cap open android
```

Or manually open the `android/` folder in Android Studio.

### 4. Configure Signing (For Release Builds)

#### Generate Keystore (First Time Only)

```bash
# Create keystore directory
mkdir -p android/keystore

# Generate release keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android/keystore/release.keystore \
  -alias sportscentral -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Follow prompts and SAVE the passwords securely!
```

#### Create keystore.properties

Create `android/keystore.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=sportscentral
storeFile=keystore/release.keystore
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Add `keystore.properties` to `.gitignore`!

### 5. Build Release APK/AAB

#### Using Android Studio:
1. Build ‚Üí Generate Signed Bundle/APK
2. Choose Android App Bundle (AAB) for Play Store
3. Select your keystore file
4. Enter passwords
5. Choose "release" build variant
6. Click Finish

#### Using Command Line:

```bash
# Build release APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Build release AAB (recommended for Play Store)
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Output locations:
# APK: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
# AAB: android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```
